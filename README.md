Chest X-ray disease detection models

## Summary
It has been rightfully emphasized that the use of AI for clinical decision making could amplify health disparities. An algorithm may encode protected characteristics, and then use this information for making predictions due to undesirable correlations in the (historical) training data. It remains unclear how we can establish whether such information is actually used. Besides the scarcity of data from underserved populations, very little is known about how dataset biases manifest in predictive models and how this may result in disparate performance. This article aims to shed some light on these issues by exploring methodology for subgroup analysis in image-based disease detection models.
